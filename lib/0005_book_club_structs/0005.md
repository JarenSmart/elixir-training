# Book Club

At this point we are going to start putting together a book club app.

The first thing we'll do is create the structs that we'll need.

We are going to need the following structs:

1. Member - This will represent a member of the book club. It will need:
  * First Name
  * Last Name

2. Book - This will represent a book for the book club. It will need:
  * Title
  * Author
  * Page Count
  * Genre

3. Club - This will represent a book club that members can attend. It will need:
  * Name
  * Meeting Day of the Week

For now, we will just create the needed structs. We will worry about connecting them together next.
